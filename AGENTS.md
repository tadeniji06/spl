i have a sanity cms setup with this projectId: 'jf22otsp',

now i want to replace the uplaoded items and stop using the local items in my directory.
i have not worked on the electronics part tho. 
but i'll send the schemas for the respective pages i want to implment -so pls just completely remove all the local itmes and images which i currently implmented.
